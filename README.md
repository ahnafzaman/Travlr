For the frontend part of this project, I worked with both Express for rendering HTML and JavaScript for adding interactivity, along with Angular for the SPA. 
The SPA made the application feel interactive while Express handled the server-side rendering. Using Angular made it easier to manage and update content without needing full-page reloads.

The backend is built with MongoDB (NoSQL database) mainly because it handles flexible and scalable data storage well. 
Since the application deals with user authentication and trip bookings, MongoDB’s schema-less structure made it easier to adapt to different data needs without strict table relationships like in SQL.

JSON is different from JavaScript because it is just a lightweight data format and not a programming language. 
It connects the frontend and backend making communication smooth. I refactored parts of the code, especially in authentication and routes to keep things modular. 
Reusable UI components in Angular made the frontend easier to maintain since I didn’t have to repeat the same code.

Testing API endpoints was a crucial step, especially with authentication. I used Postman to test requests and responses to ensure that the API worked as expected. 
Security added a layer of complexity because protected routes required valid JWT tokens and both public and private routes had to be covered during testing to ensure proper authentication and data protection.

This course helped me build a solid full-stack project from scratch, which is great for my portfolio. 
I got hands-on experience with the MEAN stack, authentication, and securing APIs, which are all useful in real-world development. 
It further improved my debugging and problem-solving skills, making me more confident in handling challenges.
